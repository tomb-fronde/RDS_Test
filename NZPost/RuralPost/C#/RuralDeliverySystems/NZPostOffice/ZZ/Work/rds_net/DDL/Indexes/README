Indexes in SQL Server Management Studio, are accessed as sub-components of tables, 
but the DDL defining them is not generated as part of the table definition.  At the
moment, no generated DDL for the table indexes is available.  

This query lists the indexes 
	select si.name, indid, so.name
	  from sysindexes si, sysobjects so
	 where si.name is not NULL
	   and so.id = si.id
	   and so.name not like 'sys%'
